# 🚀 JavaScript Arrays & Objects Challenge

Kia ora and welcome! 🎉 Today, you’ll be expanding your JavaScript skills by working with **arrays** and **objects** through a series of coding challenges.

This workshop includes:
✅ A **guided introduction** to JavaScript arrays & objects  
✅ A **self-directed learning session** on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript)  
✅ A **coding challenge** to apply what you’ve learned

## 📌 What You’ll Be Doing

### 1️⃣ Complete the FreeCodeCamp Module  
- Go to **[FreeCodeCamp Arrays & Objects Module](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript)**  
- Work through the exercises on **arrays and objects**  
- Use **console.log()** to test and understand the code  

### 2️⃣ Complete the JavaScript Challenge  
After finishing FreeCodeCamp, you’ll apply your knowledge in a **coding challenge**:  

- [ ] **Fork this repository**  
- [ ] **Download it using GitHub Desktop**  
- [ ] **Open the repo in VS Code**  
- [ ] **Read through all files (README + JavaScript files)**  
- [ ] **Install dependencies** (you’ll be using JavaScript & testing tools)  
- [ ] **Modify `arrays.js` and `objects.js` to complete the tasks**  
- [ ] **Run tests using `npm test`** to check your answers  
- [ ] **Fix any errors and re-run the tests until they all pass**  
- [ ] **Save, commit, push your changes, and share your repo link**

## 🚀 How to Get Started  

### 1️⃣ Clone & Setup the Repo  
- Open **GitHub Desktop**  
- Clone this repo and open it in **VS Code**  
- Open the terminal and run:  
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```  

---

### 2️⃣ Complete `arrays.js` and `objects.js`
- Open `arrays.js` and `objects.js`
- Read the instructions inside the files
- Use `console.log()` to debug and check your work
- Modify the code to complete each task

---

### 3️⃣ Run Tests & Debug  
- Run the following command in the terminal:  
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```  
  - If tests fail, read the error messages, fix your code, and re-run the test  
- Once all tests pass, proceed to commit your work  

---

### 4️⃣ console.log
1. run for your console log outputs 
```bash
node arrays.js 
```

---

### 5️⃣ Save, Commit & Push  
1. Go back to GitHub Desktop  
2. Review your changes under “Changes”  
3. Write a commit message (e.g., "Completed arrays & objects challenges")  
4. Click Commit to main  
5. Click Push origin
